## Story of this game

#### History of this game
- An earlier version of is game in pygame named [qShooter can be found here](https://github.com/wslu42/qShooter).
- This work is inspired by QPong made by qiskit advocate [Junye Huang](https://huangjunye.github.io/), a quantum variant of classical Pong. [Play QPong here](https://alfa871212.itch.io/qpong).


## Quantum ideas invlved in this game
In this game I am experimenting the idea to represent in-game locations with quantum states. In Qilin this is realized in controlling where the laser beams are shooting. It requires profecient understanding of 3-qubit states and the player's fast response to put together a quantum circuit which maps to the enemy's location using circuit composer. The goal is simple - shoot down as many as enemies as you can!
